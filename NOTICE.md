openGym's own code is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3.0** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## App store exception

As an additional permission under section 7 of the AGPL v3.0, the copyright holder permits
distribution of the openGym mobile application through app store platforms (such as the
Apple App Store and Google Play) whose terms of service would otherwise be incompatible
with the AGPL, provided the corresponding source code remains available under the AGPL at
the project repository. This permission applies to the distribution channel only and does
not otherwise limit the license.

## Body diagram geometry

The muscle outlines the body maps are drawn from (`frontend/src/lib/body-paths.js`) are derived
from [**MuscleMap**](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap) by Melih Colpan, used under the
**MIT License** and reproduced below. MuscleMap ships its path data as Swift source rather than
`.svg` files; the paths were converted to a JSON module, its sub-group shapes were dropped, and
nothing else about the artwork was changed.

## Exercise data & media

The exercise names, instructions (English in `frontend/src/lib/exercises-data.js`, other
languages in `frontend/src/instr/`, regenerated via `scripts/build-instructions.mjs`), images
and animations (fetched into `media/` at build time) come from
[**hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset**](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset)
and are **not** covered by openGym's AGPL license — they remain under that dataset's own terms.
The media files are not distributed in this repository; they are downloaded from the upstream
source on first run. If you redistribute openGym with the media included, review the upstream
license first.
